# java-exception-replacement-library
A system that could replace the standard java Exceptions.

This library was inspired by https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/exceptions_are_bad and most credit goes to the writer of the article, Jed Wesley-Smith.
The original article said the 'Either object' is disjoint, but that is not the case in this implementation.
There is also a 'warning' implementation that returns both the normal return value and the exception message.
